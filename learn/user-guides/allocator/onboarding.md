# Onboarding

Before you can invest in a Vault, you must complete a one-time onboarding process including submitting your KYC, reviewing and signing legal agreements to gain deposit access to a specific Vault.

> Onboarding is **Vault-specific**. Each Vault may have different KYC and legal requirements based on its fund structure and jurisdiction.

#### Complete KYC (Identity Verification)

#### Review & Sign Legal Documents

Once KYC is approved:

* You’ll see the legal agreements for the Vault:
  * Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA)
  * Subscription Agreement
* Review the documents carefully
* Use the built-in signing tool (e.g., Dropbox Sign) to digitally sign them
{% endstep %}

#### **Await Manager Approval**

* After signing, your onboarding profile is sent to the Vault Manager for final review
* The Manager may:
  * Approve your profile → You’re onboarded
  * Reject it → You’ll be notified via email

> You’ll receive a confirmation email once approved.
{% endstep %}
