# NAV Calculation

### Overview

The [NAV Engine](../../product/aleph-vehicle/nav-engine.md) converts raw data from trading venues into a verified, per-share valuation of the vault. The process is designed to produce a NAV that is accurate, transparent, and compliant with the expectations of investors and regulators.

### Dual-Method

The NAV Engine uses two independent methods to calculate NAV. Both must align within predefined tolerances before NAV can be published:

* **Accounting Method**: Applies double-entry bookkeeping principles to track all transactions and positions over time.
* **Price-Based Method**: Uses real-time market prices to value current balances and positions.

Reconciling these methods ensures NAV integrity and reduces the risk of errors.

## NAV Validation

The NAV can be **published** as the official figure only after passing both stages:

### 1. Rule-based Service

Before publication, the calculated NAV passes through a series of automated checks:

* **Trial Balance:** Total debits must equal total credits.
* **Method Reconciliation:** Price-based and Ledger-based NAV method outputs must match within tolerance thresholds.
* **Data integrity:** Balances, prices and currency exchange rates must not be stale or missing.
* **Tolerance Checks:** Large deviations or unusual profit/loss movements are flagged.
* **Fee Logic:** Current fees are compared against historical averages.
* **Consistency:** Flags for negative values, NAV per unit â‰¤ 0, or mismatched share counts.
* **Class Reconciliation:** Sum of all classes and series must equal the total vault NAV.

### 2. Manual Review & Sign-off

A review workflow allows the fund administrator to:

* Inspect the complete NAV breakdown (CEX balances, assets, liabilities, FX, fees).
* Investigate any exceptions flagged by automated checks.
* Compare the current NAV breakdown to the prior NAV settlement.
* Digitally sign off to approve and finalize the NAV.
