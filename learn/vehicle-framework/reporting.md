# Reporting

The **NAV Reporting** service includes the complete, auditable package of reports and supporting data generated each settlement cycle. These reports may be exported, reviewed, or shared with stakeholders (allocators, administrators, regulators, auditors).

* **Fund Valuation** – Definitive record of the fund’s value at month-end.
* **Investor Settlements** – Accurate basis for subscriptions, redemptions, and distributions.
* **Regulatory & Audit Compliance** – Provides full transparency and traceability for regulators, auditors, and internal governance.

### Report Types

#### NAV Statement

The NAV Statement is the main report, capturing

* Official NAV total and NAV per unit (by class/subclass).
* Units outstanding and total fund value in base currency (USD or other).
* Comparison vs. previous period NAV and % change.

#### Income Statement

The Income Statement details income and expenses recognized during the cycle, including

* Realized and unrealized gains.
* Expenses, including different fees and operational costs.&#x20;

#### Balance Sheet

The Balance Sheet presents a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity at the close of the cycle, directly reconciling to the reported NAV.

* **Assets**: CEX balances, on-chain wallet holdings, DeFi positions, and other investments
* **Liabilities**: Accrued management fees, performance fees, platform fees, administrative fees, and other obligations
* **Equity**: Net asset value reconciliation

#### Investor Statement

Investor-level activity is reflected in the Investor Statement, which shows each allocator’s holdings, subscriptions, redemptions, and distributions.

#### Trail Balance&#x20;

For accounting integrity, the Trial Balance records all ledger accounts and balances, supporting reconciliation across the fund’s activity.

#### NAV Validation

The NAV Validation Report documents the data and checks that underpin the NAV calculation, including exchange balances, wallet activity, FX rates, and fee accruals. This validation layer ensures that both internal teams and external auditors can trace every figure back to its source. It contains:

* Summary of automated checks (trial balance, reconciliation, staleness checks, tolerance thresholds).
* Exceptions flagged and resolution notes.
* Sign-off status and approver details.
