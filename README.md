# Intro

Aleph is a financial infrastructure that connects digital asset allocators with institutional funds.

Aleph is a financial infrastructure that brings institutional funds into open finance while preserving&#x20;

We build a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace that enables allocators to instantly access money managers with diversified alpha strategies, while maintaining the key controls expected in traditional finance.

Designed for asset managers, digital asset funds, and accredited allocators, Aleph's blockchain-based architecture streamlines complex on-chain and off-chain tasks, eliminates bureaucratic frictions, reduces operational costs, and enhances capital efficiency.

### Who is Aleph for?

**Managers**&#x20;

Institutional funds that generate yield from economic activities outside the closed loop of on-chain protocols, where the key profit drivers are liquidity depth, market structure, latency, and proprietary alpha-generating models.

**Allocators**

Crypto natives, high-net-worth individuals, foundations, fund of funds, family offices, and private placement funds. They pursue over-performing, risk-adjusted returns.
