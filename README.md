# Intro

Aleph brings institutional funds into open finance.&#x20;

We build a secure, transparent, and efficient infrastructure that enables allocators to instantly access institutional asset managers with diversified yield strategies, while maintaining the key controls expected in traditional finance.

Designed for asset managers, digital asset funds, and accredited allocators, Aleph's blockchain-based architecture streamlines complex on-chain and off-chain tasks, eliminates bureaucratic frictions, reduces operational costs, and enhances capital formation.

### Who is Aleph for?

**Managers**&#x20;

Institutional funds that generate yield from economic activities outside the closed loop of on-chain protocols, where the key profit drivers are liquidity depth, market structure, latency, and proprietary alpha-generating models.

**Allocators**

Accredited investors, foundations, fund of funds, family offices, and private placement funds. They pursue over-performing, risk-adjusted returns.
