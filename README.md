# Aleph Protocol Documentation

## Overview

Aleph is a financial infrastructure for uncorrelated yield strategies, connecting digital asset allocators with institutional money managers.

We build a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace that enables allocators to instantly access money managers with diversified alpha strategies, while maintaining the key controls expected in traditional finance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Aleph's blockchain-based architecture streamlines complex on-chain and off-chain tasks, eliminates bureaucratic frictions, reduces operational costs, and enhances capital efficiency.

### Core Components

- **Aleph Vault**: Custom smart contracts for asynchronous deposits and redemptions
- **NAV Engine**: Off-chain service for Net Asset Value calculations and settlements
- **Accountant**: Fee management and distribution system
- **AlephOS**: Operational dashboard for managers and allocators

## üë• Who is Aleph for?

### Managers
Institutional money managers who generate uncorrelated yield strategies from economic activities outside the closed loop of on-chain protocols. The trades are executed through exchanges or prime brokerage, where the key profit drivers are:
- Liquidity depth
- Latency optimization
- Market structure
- Proprietary alpha-generating models

### Allocators
- Crypto natives
- High-net-worth individuals
- Curators
- Foundations
- Fund of funds
- Family offices
- Wealth funds
- Fintechs
- Private placement funds

They pursue over-performing, risk-adjusted returns through diversified strategies.
