# Intro

Aleph is a financial infrastructure for uncorrelated yield strategies, connecting digital asset allocators with institutional money managers.

We build a secure, transparent, and efficient marketplace that enables allocators to instantly access money managers with diversified alpha strategies, while maintaining the key controls expected in traditional finance.

Designed for asset managers, digital asset funds, and sophisticated allocators, Aleph's blockchain-based architecture streamlines complex on-chain and off-chain tasks, eliminates bureaucratic frictions, reduces operational costs, and enhances capital efficiency.

### Who is Aleph for?

**Managers**&#x20;

Institutional money managers who generate uncorrelated yield strategies from economic activities outside the closed loop of on-chain protocols. The trades are executed through exchanges or prime brokerage, where the key profit drivers are liquidity depth, latency, market structure, and proprietary alpha-generating models.

**Allocators**

Crypto natives, high-net-worth individuals, curators, foundations, fund of funds, family offices, wealth funds, fintechs, and private placement funds. They pursue over-performing, risk-adjusted returns.
