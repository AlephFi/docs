### Key Details

* Allocators must be whitelisted and complete the required [verification](allocators.md#verification) before being eligible to access the manager vault.
* Eligible allocators can queue their deposit at any given time by executing a deposit request.
* Upon [settlement](../../learn/flows/settlement.md), the deposited assets are transferred to the manager, the vault mints new shares, and the allocators receive shares proportional to the vault AUM.&#x20;
* A share unit represents the principal and accrued interest, and the underlying share value is derived from the yield-generating activities of the manager. &#x20;
* Allocators can queue their redemption by executing a redeem request.
* Upon settlement, the redeemed assets are transferred to the allocator, and the vault burns the specified shares.
* Allocators can view the pending deposit and redeem request through the Allocator app.
