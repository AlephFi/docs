# Aleph Vehicle

The system is designed to manage allocator lifecycle, handle diverse fund operations, and meet regulatory requirements through three vertically-integrated layers:&#x20;

### **Aleph Vaults**

A suite of smart contracts built to simplify financial and operational interactions for managers and allocators, handles subscriptions, Classes and Series, High Water Marks, fee accrual, and capital distribution.

### NAV Engine&#x20;

Responsible for calculating the Net Asset Value (NAV). The system fetches raw data from off-chain trading venues, applies valuation and fee logic, and publishes results on-chain to settle deposits and redemptions.

### AlephOS

Unified web application that streamlines fund and admin operations, designed to support the entire allocator lifecycle. Manager can configure key controls through an intuitive interface, approve allocator onboarding, and handle deeds seamlessly with metrics cockpit, automated compliance, and comprehensive reporting.
